        <h4>Site</h4>
        <p>
          Jet Protocol provides access to a decentralized finance application
          (the
          <b>“Application”</b>) on the Solana Blockchain, that allows
          individuals to borrow and lend Solana assets (the
          <b>“Cryptocurrency Assets”</b>) and transact using smart contracts
          (the <b>“Smart Contracts”</b>).
        </p>

        <p>
          Using the Jet Protocol may require that you pay a fee, such as
          transaction fees on the Solana network to perform a transaction. You
          acknowledge and agree that Jet Protocol has no control over any
          transactions, the method of payment of any transactions or any
          actual payments of transactions. Accordingly, you must ensure that
          you have a sufficient balance of the applicable cryptocurrency
          tokens stored at your protocol-compatible wallet address (<b
            >“Cryptocurrency Wallet”</b
          >) to complete any transaction on the Jet Protocol or the Solana
          network before initiating such a transaction.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes
          through informal, good faith negotiations. If a potential dispute
          arises, you must contact us by sending an email to
          hello@jetprotocol.io so that we can attempt to resolve it without
          resorting to formal dispute resolution. If we aren’t able to reach
          an informal resolution within sixty days of your email, then you and
          we both agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the
          process set forth below.
        </p>

        <h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
        <p>
          With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they
          have obtained or used the site for personal, commercial or other
          purposes, all disputes, controversies or claims must be brought in
          the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class
          member in any purported class action, collective action or other
          representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration,
          and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate
          more than one person’s claims. You agree that, by entering into this
          agreement, you and Jet Protocol are each waiving the right to a
          trial by jury or to participate in a class action, collective
          action, or other representative proceeding of any kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in relation to
          these Terms, including (but not limited) to the validity,
          invalidity, breach or termination thereof, the Site, or any other
          acts or omissions for which you may content that we are liable,
          including (but not limited to) any claim or controversy as to
          arbitrability, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with
          the JAMS Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures. The number of
          arbitrators shall be one or three; the seat of the arbitration shall
          be determined by the arbitrator(s); the arbitral proceedings shall
          be conducted in English. The applicable law shall be California.
        </p>
        <p>
          You understand that you are required to resolve all Disputes by
          binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be held on a confidential
          basis before a single arbitrator, who shall be selected pursuant to
          JAMS rules. The arbitration will be held in San Francisco,
          California, unless you and we both agree to hold it elsewhere.
          Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your
          claims with those of any other party. Any judgment on the award
          rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
          jurisdiction.
        </p>

        </p>
        <ul>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Privacy Practices:</h4>
        <p>
          We do not "sell" the personal information we collect (as such term
          is defined in the CCPA) for monetary value (and will not sell it
          without providing a right to opt out). Like many companies, we may
          use third-party cookies for our advertising purposes.
        </p>

        <h4>Privacy Rights:</h4>
        <p>The CCPA grants individuals the following rights:</p>

            <b>Information:</b> You can request information about how we have collected,
            used and shared your personal information during the past 12 months.

            the What We Collect section of this Policy. We collect this information

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example,
          prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in
          response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in
          which we must comply with a deletion request. We will also respond
          to requests for information and access only to the extent we are
          able to associate with a reasonable effort the information we
          maintain with the identifying details you provide in your request.
          If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you.

          discrimination.

          submitting a request to access or delete personal information before
          providing a substantive response to the request. We will ask you to
          verify your identity when you submit a request.

        <h4>How Does Jet Protocol Protect My Personal Information?</h4>
        <p>
          To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and
          use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These
          measures include computer safeguards and secured files and
          buildings.
        </p>
        <h4>Why Can’t I Limit All Sharing?</h4>
        <p>
          Applicable laws give you the right to limit only (1) sharing for
          affiliates’ everyday business purposes, (2) affiliates from using
          your information to market to you, and (3) share for nonaffiliates
          to market to you. We do not share any information to any of those
          parties for those reasons; thus, you may not limit sharing of
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          As used in this Additional Disclosures section, "affiliates" refer
          to companies related by common ownership or control; "nonaffiliates"
          refer to companies no related by common ownership or control; and
          "joint marketing" refers to a formal agreement between nonaffiliated
          financial companies that together market financial products or
          services to you.
